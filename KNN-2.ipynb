    "The main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric in K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) lies in how they measure\n",

    "Euclidean Distance (L2)= sqrt(∑ i=1n (xi −yi)^2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: Euclidean distance measures the length of the shortest path between two points in a continuous space. It considers both horizontal \n",
